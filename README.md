A Loosely-Coupled Flash Game Development Library
------

This library consists of a collection of classes which can be used independently of one another, and that will hopefully make your Flash game development taks that much easier. One of the main functions is to enable Flash GPU rendering mode by rasterizing vector assets at runtime and caching them for use in your game or application. In addition, the library includes A-Star pathfinding helper, ready-made display objects that work with the bitmap caching scheme, and general helper and utility classes.

This is a collection of code that I've had sitting around for a while, so I'm not sure how often it will be updated, although if there is interest it's cetainly a possiblity.
