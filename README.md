A Loosely-Coupled Flash Game Development Library
------

This library consists of a collection of classes which can be used independently of one another, that will hopefully make your Flash game development tasks that much easier. One of the main goals is to enable Flash GPU rendering mode by rasterizing vector assets at runtime and caching them for use in your game or application. In addition, the library includes some custom display objects that work within the bitmap caching scheme, along with some general game-dev helper classes.

This is a collection of code that I've had sitting around for a while, so I'm not sure how often it will be updated, although if there is interest it's cetainly a possiblity. Everything here has been tested thoroughly in live projects. Please submit any bugs you find.
